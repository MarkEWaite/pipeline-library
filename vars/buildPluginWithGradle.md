Builds a Jenkins plugin using Gradle.

The implementation follows the standard build/test/archive pattern.  Note that the current version does not allow configuring the `jenkinsVersion`.

**Usage:** The method can be used in the same way as `buildPlugin()` for Maven projects.
See the [documentation in the README](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/pipeline-library?tab=readme-ov-file) of the Pipeline Library repository.
